Also, the configuration of latent embeddings highly depends on the scale parameter \\(\\gamma\\) of the latent space. Rather than choosing sub-optimal tuning parameters, we use a layer of hyper-priors to learn optimal values of these parameters from data. We choose hyperparameters such that priors are minimally informative to facilitate the flexible Bayesian learning.\npseudo code  3.2 Normal data with a noninformative prior distribution org-id:{ce3939d9-fb55-4b01-8747-0f486c98c9e7}:org-id Continuous distributions org-id:{5c29e214-f86d-41d5-89a0-e164602bf6b8}:org-id  update \\(\\kappa_{m}\\)  all \\(k\\) person\u0026rsquo;s having action m, all l ∈ A_m (all possible actions that can jump from m) transition start and stop time \\(dt_{k,n}\\) for all \\(\\delta_{k,n,m} = 1\\) For each \\(k,c\\), a symmetric MH jumping \\(J(\\kappa_{m}^{(l-1)} \\rightarrow \\kappa_{m}^{* })\\) is used to propose a new sample.
